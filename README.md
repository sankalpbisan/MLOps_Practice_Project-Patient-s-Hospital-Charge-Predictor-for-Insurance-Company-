## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting hospital charges for patients using machine learning. It is designed as an MLOps practice project to demonstrate end-to-end workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring. The goal is to provide accurate predictions to help hospitals and patients estimate medical costs.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **MLOps Integration**: Implements CI/CD pipelines for model training and deployment.
- **API Endpoint**: Deploys the model as a REST API for real-time predictions.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks model performance and data drift in production.
